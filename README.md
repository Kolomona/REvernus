# REvernus
REvernus is a rewrite of Evernus in C# 8.0 using .Net Core 3.0 and WPF.

## Notice for those running REvernus
Currently REvernus is being ran on .Net Core 3.0, which is currently in development and will require you to download and 
install the [.Net Core 3.0 Preview 3 **Runtime** for Windows](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

## Notice for those building REvernus
Net Core 3.0 does not come with Visual Studio 2019 by default (at least until we get offical support) and you will need to
download the [.Net Core 3.0 **SDK** Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) and install the [Visual Studio 2019 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/)
